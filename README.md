# FUTURE_ML_02 — Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Task 2 from the Future Interns Machine Learning Internship. The task focuses on building a predictive model for stock prices using historical data.

## Objective
- Develop a machine learning model to forecast stock prices.
- Perform time series analysis and regression.
- Evaluate the model’s performance on real stock market data.

## Dataset
Dataset used: AADR stock prices from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data?resource=download]

Features include Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume.

## Tools and Technologies
 Programming Language: Python

 Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

 Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Methodology
 Data Preprocessing: Parsing dates, handling missing values.

 Feature Selection: Using relevant features to predict the Close price.

 Model Training: Linear Regression for price prediction.

 Evaluation: Model accuracy measured using R-squared score.

 Visualization: Plotting actual vs predicted stock prices.

## Results
Achieved model confidence (R² score) of approximately 0.92.

Visualized predictions closely align with actual stock prices, indicating a good model fit.

## How to Run
Clone the repository.

Install required Python libraries (see requirements.txt if provided).

Run the Jupyter Notebook stock_price_prediction.ipynb.
